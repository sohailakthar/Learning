                <p>
                    Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist known for his nonviolent resistance in leading India to independence from British rule. His honorific title "Mahātmā," meaning "great-souled" or "venerable," reflects his revered status globally.<br><br>Born in Gujarat, Gandhi studied law in London and began practicing in India. He gained prominence during his time in South Africa, where he championed civil rights using nonviolent methods. Returning to India in 1915, he organized protests against land tax and discrimination, advocating for unity and self-sufficiency.<br><br>Gandhi assumed leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 and spearheaded campaigns against poverty, women's rights, and untouchability. He embraced a minimalist lifestyle, donning hand-spun clothes and using fasting for self-purification and political protest.<br><br>His symbolic acts left an indelible impact. The historic Dandi Salt March in 1930 challenged British salt taxes, and his call for the Quit India Movement in 1942 demanded an end to British rule. He endured numerous imprisonments, steadfastly promoting nonviolent resistance.<br><br>Gandhi's vision of a harmonious, independent India faced challenges during the partition of British India in 1947, resulting in the creation of India and Pakistan. He actively worked to ease religious tensions during this time.<br><br>Tragically, Gandhi was assassinated in 1948. His birthday, October 2, is celebrated as Gandhi Jayanti in India and the International Day of Nonviolence worldwide. His principles of nonviolence, civil disobedience, and social justice continue to inspire movements for change across the globe.

                <h2 class="subheading">Early life and background</h2>
                <p>
                    Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was part of a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi, served as the chief minister of Porbandar. Despite a modest education, Karamchand proved capable, marrying four times and becoming an adept chief minister.<br><br>Gandhi's birth coincided with his mother Putlibai's last child, in a dim room in Porbandar. As a child, he was described as restless and fond of playful mischief. Influenced by Indian classics, he developed a profound connection with truth and love as core values.<br><br>The Gandhi family's religious background was diverse. His father was Hindu, while his mother was from the Pranami Vaishnava tradition. His mother's piety deeply influenced him, instilling a strong commitment to fasting and prayer.<br><br>In 1874, Gandhi's family moved to Rajkot, where he attended local schools. At age 9, he joined a nearby school, and at 11, he enrolled in Alfred High School. Though an average student, he was introspective and bookish.<br><br>At 13, he was married to Kasturbai Kapadia in an arranged marriage. Losing a year of school, he later caught up by accelerating his studies. However, he recalled feeling possessive and lustful toward his young bride.<br><br>Gandhi's father passed away in 1885 when he was 16. He and his wife experienced the death of their first baby, causing them great pain. Despite these hardships, they had four more sons.<br><br>After graduating high school in 1887, Gandhi briefly attended Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State but dropped out, returning to his family in Porbandar.<br><br>Gandhi's early life laid the foundation for his later transformative role in India's fight for independence through nonviolent resistance.

                <h2 class="subheading">Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914)</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1893, at the age of 23, Gandhi journeyed to South Africa as a lawyer. Over the course of 21 years there, he honed his political beliefs and principles, profoundly impacted by the discrimination and injustice he witnessed.<br><br>Upon arrival, Gandhi encountered racial prejudice, facing discrimination on public transportation and even physical assault. These experiences ignited his determination to fight for his rights and those of his fellow Indians.<br><br>Initially considering himself a Briton first and an Indian second, Gandhi's perception shifted due to the mistreatment he and his community faced from British settlers. He began questioning his people's status within the British Empire.<br><br>Gandhi's involvement escalated when a discriminatory proposal by the Natal government prompted him to stay longer. He campaigned against a bill aiming to strip Indians of their voting rights. Though the bill passed, his efforts spotlighted Indian grievances and laid the groundwork for future activism.<br><br>He co-founded the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, uniting South Africa's Indian community politically. Despite facing violent opposition, Gandhi persevered. During the Boer War, he led Indian volunteers as part of the Natal Indian Ambulance Corps, challenging stereotypes about Indian capabilities.<br><br>In 1906, the Transvaal government enforced a registration Act for Indians and Chinese. Gandhi adopted his concept of Satyagraha, or nonviolent protest, in response. He urged Indians to resist the law and accept punishment, showcasing his ideas of peaceful resistance, persuasion, and public engagement.<br><br>Gandhi's transformative experiences in South Africa laid the foundation for his future activism and leadership, significantly shaping his approach to social and political change.

                <h2 class="subheading">Struggle for Indian independence (1915–1947)</h2>
                <p>
                    From 1915 to 1947, Gandhi led the struggle for India's independence with a powerful mix of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience. Upon his return to India in 1915, he joined the Indian National Congress and, under the influence of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, began shaping his approach to Indian issues.<br><br>Gandhi's leadership within the Congress grew, culminating in him becoming its leader in 1920. His demands for Indian self-rule escalated, and in 1930, the Congress declared India's independence, though the British did not recognize it. Negotiations and protests followed, with Gandhi's call for immediate independence in 1942 leading to his imprisonment, along with many other Congress leaders.<br><br>The Khilafat movement, aiming to restore the Caliph in Turkey, temporarily united Hindus and Muslims under Gandhi's leadership. However, tensions escalated, and by 1922, the movement collapsed, leading Gandhi to shift his focus to swaraj and complete political independence.<br><br>Gandhi's non-cooperation and civil disobedience campaigns gained momentum, emphasizing boycotts of British products and institutions, along with spinning khadi (homespun cloth). His Salt March in 1930, a 240-mile journey to Dandi, marked a significant protest against the British salt tax. Gandhi's campaigns resulted in mass arrests and the brutal suppression of protests, but also raised awareness and built momentum for Indian independence.<br><br>Despite divisions within the Indian National Congress and challenges from opposing factions, Gandhi's unwavering commitment to nonviolent resistance made him a symbol of hope and change for millions of Indians striving for self-rule.

                <h2 class="subheading">Death</h2>
                <p>
                    On January 30, 1948, at 5:17 pm, Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti). Gandhi was on his way to a prayer meeting when Godse fired three fatal shots into his chest. Gandhi died on the spot, and his death deeply affected the nation.<br><br>Nehru addressed the nation over the radio, expressing the immense loss and darkness that Gandhi's death had brought. Godse, along with other conspirators, was apprehended and brought to trial. The trial resulted in convictions, with Godse and Narayan Apte receiving death sentences, and others receiving varying punishments.<br><br>Gandhi's funeral procession was attended by over a million people, mourning his loss and paying their respects. His body was cremated according to Hindu tradition, and his ashes were immersed in various locations, including the Sangam at Allahabad and the Nile River in Uganda. Memorials, such as Gandhi Smriti and Raj Ghat, were established to honor his legacy. Gandhi's final words, "Hē Rāma," are etched on a black marble platform at Raj Ghat.
