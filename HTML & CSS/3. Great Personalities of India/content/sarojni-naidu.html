                <h2 class="subheading">Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Sarojini Naidu (1879–1949) was an Indian political activist and poet, known as the "Nightingale of
                    India." She held significant roles in the Indian independence movement, advocating civil rights,
                    women's emancipation, and anti-imperialism. Naidu was the first Indian woman to lead the Indian
                    National Congress and serve as a state governor. Born in Hyderabad to a Bengali family, she studied
                    in Madras, London, and Cambridge, engaging in suffrage work in Britain. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's
                    principles of swaraj, she joined the national movement, eventually becoming Congress president in
                    1925. Her poetic work, praised for its imagery and lyrical quality, covered various themes,
                    including patriotism and tragedy. Notably, her poem "In the Bazaars of Hyderabad," published in
                    1912, remains widely celebrated.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Personal Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Sarojini Naidu, born on 13 February 1879 in Hyderabad, was the eldest child of Aghorenath
                    Chattopadhyay, a Bengali Brahmin and the principal of Nizam College. Her father, who hailed from
                    Brahmangaon Bikrampur in Dhaka, held a doctorate of Science from Edinburgh University. Her mother
                    was a Bengali poet. Sarojini had seven siblings, including Virendranath Chattopadhyay, a
                    revolutionary, and Harindranath Chattopadhyay, a poet and dramatist. Their family, known for its
                    contributions, enjoyed a respected status in Hyderabad.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Education</h2>
                <p>
                    Sarojini Naidu excelled in her matriculation examination, securing the highest rank, at the age of
                    twelve in 1891. She pursued further studies in England from 1895 to 1898, attending King's College,
                    London, and Girton College, Cambridge, where she received a scholarship sponsored by the Nizam of
                    Hyderabad. During her time in England, she encountered artists associated with the Aesthetic and
                    Decadent movements.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Marriage</h2>
                <p>
                    After returning to Hyderabad in 1898, Chattopadhyay married Govindaraju Naidu, a physician she had
                    met during her time in England. Their marriage, deemed "groundbreaking and scandalous," received
                    approval from both families. The union was harmonious, and they had five children. Their daughter
                    Padmaja actively participated in the Quit India Movement and later held significant government
                    positions in independent India.

                <h2 class="subheading">Political Career</h2>
                <p>
                    Starting in 1904, Naidu gained popularity as an eloquent speaker, advocating for Indian independence
                    and women's rights, particularly women's education. Her speeches often followed the Nyaya rhetorical
                    structure. Notable addresses included the Indian National Congress and Indian Social Conference in
                    1906. Naidu's social efforts during a flood earned her the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in 1911, which she
                    later returned in protest of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. She met Mahatma Gandhi in 1914,
                    inspiring her political commitment. Naidu became the second woman President of the Indian National
                    Congress and, alongside Muthulakshmi Reddy, founded the Women's Indian Association in 1917. She
                    supported universal suffrage in London with Annie Besant and the Lucknow Pact in India. Close to
                    Gandhi, Naidu joined his satyagraha movement in 1917 and participated in the Salt March. She led the
                    campaign after Gandhi's arrest and took part in Round Table Conferences. Jailed by the British in
                    1932 and 1942, she became India's first female governor in 1947, serving until her death in 1949.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Writing Career</h2>
                <p>
                    Sarojini Naidu began writing at 12, impressing the Nizam of Hyderabad with her play "Maher Muneer"
                    in Persian. Her English poetry, influenced by British Romanticism, showcased rich sensory imagery
                    and vivid depictions of India. She was often referred to as the "Indian Yeats." Her first book, "The
                    Golden Threshold," published in 1905, introduced her lyrical style. "The Bird of Time," published in
                    1912, displayed strong nationalist themes, including the famous poem "In the Bazaars of Hyderabad."
                    "The Broken Wing" (1917) and "The Gift of India" criticized British exploitation. Her speeches were
                    collected in "The Speeches and Writings of Sarojini Naidu." She edited works, including "Muhammad
                    Ali Jinnah, An Ambassador of Unity," and her complete poems were published posthumously in "The
                    Feather of the Dawn" (1961).
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Death</h2>
                <p>
                    Sarojini Naidu passed away due to cardiac arrest at 3:30 p.m. (IST) on March 2, 1949, at the
                    Government House in Lucknow. Her health had deteriorated after returning from New Delhi on February
                    15, leading to the cancellation of official engagements. Bloodletting was performed on March 1 after
                    she complained of a severe headache, and she collapsed following a fit of cough. Naidu's last
                    moments included her requesting the attending nurse to sing to her, after which she peacefully
                    slept. Her final rites took place at the Gomati River.
