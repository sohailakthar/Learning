                <h2 class="subheading">Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Subhas Chandra Bose (1897–1945) was an Indian nationalist leader who defied British authority, becoming a hero among Indians. His wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, however, raise concerns about authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. The honorific "Netaji" (Hindi: "Respected Leader") was applied to him, now widely used in India.<br><br>Born into a privileged Bengali family, Bose joined India's nationalist movement after education in England. He led a group in the Indian National Congress favoring socialism. Bose became Congress president in 1938 but faced disputes with leaders like Gandhi, leading to his resignation. He arrived in Nazi Germany in 1941, forming the Indian National Army (INA) with Japanese support. Despite charismatic leadership, INA's military impact was short-lived. After Japan's defeat, Bose died in a plane crash in 1945.<br><br>Bose's legacy is complex. He's a hero to many for challenging British rule, but his alliances with Fascist regimes raise ethical concerns about his stance on anti-Semitism and authoritarianism.

                <h2 class="subheading">Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Subhas Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, which was then part of the Orissa Division of Bengal Province in British India. He was the ninth child and sixth son of Prabhavati Bose and Janakinath Bose. Janakinath, a lawyer loyal to the British government, was keen on providing his sons with an English education. Subhas attended Protestant European School and later Ravenshaw Collegiate School, where he became more interested in Indian culture and spirituality.<br><br>In 1913, Subhas enrolled at Presidency College, Calcutta, studying philosophy and developing a strong bond with Hemanta Kumar Sarkar. He explored spiritual matters and traveled in search of a guru, leading to an expulsion from Presidency College. He eventually continued his studies at Scottish Church College, receiving his B.A. with honors in philosophy in 1918.<br><br>At his father's insistence, Subhas traveled to England in 1919 to prepare for the Indian Civil Services (ICS) examination. He later decided against pursuing the ICS, citing his desire to serve his country in a more meaningful manner. Subhas began engaging with Indian political leaders, including C. R. Das, and decided to return to Calcutta.<br><br>Subhas Chandra Bose's early years were marked by his exposure to diverse educational experiences, his spiritual exploration, and his growing interest in India's struggle for independence.

                <h2 class="subheading">Indian National Congress</h2>
                <p>
                    At the age of 24, Subhas Chandra Bose returned to India in 1921 and sought an audience with Mahatma Gandhi to discuss India's struggle for independence. Their meeting revealed ideological differences, as Bose favored more aggressive and diverse means to achieve freedom, while Gandhi adhered to non-violence. Despite this, Bose found a mentor in Chittaranjan Das, a prominent nationalist leader in Bengal, and became deeply involved in Indian politics.<br><br>Bose played an active role within the Indian National Congress, taking on various responsibilities. He launched the newspaper Swaraj, led the Indian Youth Congress, and became Secretary of the Bengal State Congress. He also served as CEO of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and participated in protest marches, facing arrests and imprisonment.<br><br>In 1927, after his release from prison, Bose became the general secretary of the Congress party and worked closely with Jawaharlal Nehru to advance the cause of Indian independence. He organized significant events, including the Annual Meeting of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta in 1928, where he introduced a volunteer corps in uniform. His approach to organizing and his uniform choice drew both praise and criticism, even from Mahatma Gandhi, who disapproved of the militaristic appearance.<br><br>Subhas Chandra Bose's role within the Indian National Congress marked a period of energetic activism and strategic engagement in India's fight for freedom, even as his methods sometimes differed from the non-violent approach advocated by Mahatma Gandhi.

                <h2 class="subheading">Collaboration with Nazi Germany</h2>
                <p>
                    During his time in Germany, Subhas Chandra Bose was associated with the Special Bureau for India, a group responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio. He established the Free India Center in Berlin and formed the Indian Legion, comprised of around 4,500 Indian prisoners of war who had been captured by Axis forces after fighting for the British in North Africa. The Indian Legion was initially attached to the Wehrmacht and later transferred to the Waffen SS. Its members took an oath of allegiance to both Adolf Hitler and Bose, recognizing Bose's leadership over India.<br><br>Bose's relationship with Emilie Schenkl became public, and they lived together in a residence provided by the German Foreign Office. Despite personal conflicts within the Special Bureau for India regarding Emilie, the Germans refrained from interfering. Their daughter was born in November 1942.<br><br>Bose's hopes for substantial support from Nazi Germany were dashed, as they considered him less popular than Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. By 1942, with the German army facing challenges in the USSR, Bose shifted his focus to Southeast Asia, where Japan had achieved victories. However, even after a meeting with Hitler, Bose realized that the Nazi leader was more interested in propaganda than actual military assistance.<br><br>In February 1943, Bose left Emilie and their daughter, traveling via German and Japanese submarines to Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia. Although he had recruited the Indian Legion in Germany, his departure left them without effective leadership. Bose's experience in Germany revealed a complex interplay of alliances, ambitions, and challenges as he sought international support for India's struggle for independence.

                <h2 class="subheading">Ideology</h2>
                <p>
                    Subhas Chandra Bose's political and ideological beliefs were complex and evolved over time. He drew inspiration from various sources, including Hindu spirituality, Swami Vivekananda's teachings, and a synthesis of different political ideologies. His beliefs encompassed elements of socialism, nationalism, and authoritarianism, which led to both admiration and criticism.<br><br>Bose considered the Bhagavad Gita as a source of inspiration for India's struggle against British colonialism. He was influenced by Swami Vivekananda's emphasis on universalism, social service, and reform. Some scholars believe that Hindu spirituality played a significant role in his political and social thought.<br><br>Bose's ideological journey included a preference for a synthesis of socialism and fascism, which he expressed in a 1930 speech. He later criticized Jawaharlal Nehru's statement about communism and fascism, suggesting that a synthesis between communism and fascism could find a place in India. He believed that authoritarianism could bring about the liberation and reconstruction of Indian society. Bose admired authoritarian methods seen in Italy and Germany during the 1930s and believed they could be applied in India's struggle for independence.<br><br>His stance on democracy evolved during the war, and he considered a socialist state similar to Soviet Russia necessary for India's reconstruction. Despite his alliance with Axis powers during World War II, Bose's beliefs also included support for women's empowerment, secularism, and liberal ideas. However, his association with Nazi Germany raises ethical dilemmas due to his alliance with a genocidal regime.<br><br>Bose's views on anti-Semitism are also debated. While he initially denounced Nazi racial policies and persecution of Jews, he later published an article in a Nazi journal discussing Jews' role in supporting British exploitation of Indians. This stance led to controversy and condemnation.<br><br>In summary, Subhas Chandra Bose's beliefs and actions were multifaceted and sometimes contradictory. He drew inspiration from various sources, including Hindu philosophy and Western ideologies, and his views evolved as he navigated India's struggle for independence and its complex geopolitical landscape during World War II.

                <h2 class="subheading">Death</h2>
                <p>
                    Subhas Chandra Bose's death occurred on 18 August 1945 as a result of third-degree burns sustained in a plane crash in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan). He had been traveling on an overloaded Japanese plane when it crashed shortly after takeoff. The plane's engine failed, causing it to crash, break into two, and explode in flames. Bose, along with other passengers, survived the initial crash but was soaked in gasoline. When he and his assistant attempted to escape, Bose's gasoline-soaked clothes caught fire, resulting in severe burns.<br><br>Bose was rushed to a military hospital in Taihoku (now Taipei), Taiwan, for treatment. Despite the efforts of the medical staff, Bose's condition deteriorated, and he went into a coma. He passed away a few hours later on the same day, 18 August 1945, at the age of 48.<br><br>After his death, Bose's body was cremated in the main Taihoku crematorium on 20 August 1945. His ashes were eventually transferred to Tokyo and handed over to the president of the Tokyo Indian Independence League. A memorial service was held for Bose in Tokyo, and his ashes were placed in the Renkōji Temple of Nichiren Buddhism, where they remain to this day.<br><br>Bose's death led to a range of reactions among different groups. Some of his supporters, especially in Bengal, refused to believe the circumstances of his death and embraced conspiracy theories. The Indian National Congress, in general, acknowledged Bose's patriotism but also expressed reservations about his actions and collaborations. The Indian soldiers in the British Indian army had mixed opinions about the Indian National Army (INA), with some viewing them as traitors and others sympathizing with their cause.<br><br>Subhas Chandra Bose's legacy continues to be a subject of discussion and debate, and his death remains surrounded by myths and controversies.
