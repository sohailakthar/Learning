                <h2 class="subheading">Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Tipu Sultan, known as the Tiger of Mysore (1751–1799), was an Indian Muslim ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore in South India. He pioneered rocket artillery and introduced administrative reforms, including a new coinage system, calendar, and land revenue system. Tipu engaged in conflicts against the British and neighboring powers, using his French-trained army in alliance with the French. He won victories in the Second Anglo-Mysore War and negotiated the Treaty of Mangalore in 1784. Despite losing territory in subsequent wars, he remained a steadfast opponent of the British East India Company. In the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, he was defeated and killed while defending Seringapatam.

                <h2 class="subheading">Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Tipu Sultan was born on December 1, 1751, in Devanahalli, near present-day Bangalore. He was named after the saint Tipu Mastan Aulia of Arcot. Despite his father Hyder Ali's illiteracy, he was determined to provide Tipu with a royal education and early exposure to military and political matters. Tipu assumed significant responsibilities from the age of 17, undertaking important diplomatic and military missions. He played a pivotal role alongside his father in various wars, contributing to Hyder Ali's emergence as a dominant ruler in southern India.<br><br>Hyder Ali, a military officer in the service of the Kingdom of Mysore, had effectively become the ruler in 1761. Tipu's mother, Fatima Fakhr-un-Nisa, was the daughter of Mir Muin-ud-Din, the governor of the fort of Kadapa. Under Hyder Ali's guidance, Tipu received a comprehensive education, including Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Kannada, Beary, the Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, and skills such as riding, shooting, and fencing.<br><br>Tipu Sultan's primary language was Urdu, and the French observers noted that they also conversed in Persian. The term "Moors" was used in Europe to refer to Urdu. Tipu's linguistic abilities enabled effective communication and diplomatic interactions with diverse communities.

                <h2 class="subheading">Early Conflicts</h2>
                <p>
                    Under the guidance of French officers in his father's employ, Tipu Sultan received instruction in military tactics. At the age of 15, he joined his father in the First Mysore War against the British in 1766. Displaying early leadership, he led a cavalry corps during the invasion of Carnatic in 1767 at just 16 years old. His military prowess was further evident in the First Anglo-Maratha War of 1775–1779.<br><br>Alexander Beatson, who wrote about the Fourth Mysore War, offered a physical description of Tipu Sultan: He stood around five feet eight inches tall, with a short neck and square shoulders, carrying a somewhat corpulent build. He had small feet and hands, large expressive eyes, arched eyebrows, and an aquiline nose. His fair complexion and dignified countenance left an impression of stature.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Second Anglo-Mysore War</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1779, the British seized the French-controlled port of Mahé, which Tipu Sultan had safeguarded. This event prompted his father, Hyder Ali, to launch an invasion of the Carnatic region to expel the British from Madras. During this campaign, in September 1780, Tipu Sultan led 10,000 troops and 18 guns to intercept Colonel William Baillie, defeating him decisively in the Battle of Pollilur. The British suffered heavy casualties, and Tipu's strategic victory forced the retreat of another British force under Sir Hector Munro.<br><br>In February 1782, Tipu Sultan defeated Colonel Braithwaite's forces at Annagudi near Tanjore, capturing all the guns and prisoners. He continued his successful military campaigns by seizing Chittur from the British in December 1781.<br><br>Upon Hyder Ali's death in December 1782, Tipu Sultan ascended to power and realized the emerging threat posed by the British in India. He officially became the ruler of Mysore on December 22, 1782, and set out to counter the British advances by forging alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals.<br><br>His efforts during the Second Mysore War culminated in the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore, which marked a temporary end to hostilities between Tipu Sultan and the British. His military prowess and strategic acumen established him as a significant force in the region.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Third Anglo-Mysore War</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1789, Tipu Sultan challenged the acquisition of Dutch-held fortresses in Cochin by Dharma Raja of Travancore. He launched an attack on Travancore's lines but was met with strong resistance, leading to a stalemate. Seeking British assistance, the Maharajah of Travancore appealed to the East India Company.<br><br>Lord Cornwallis mobilized British and company forces, forming alliances with the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad to oppose Tipu. In 1790, the British advanced and took control of much of Coimbatore district. Tipu counter-attacked, regaining territory but failing to capture Coimbatore.<br><br>In 1791, Tipu faced advances from various opponents. He employed a "scorched earth" policy, denying resources to the British. Despite initial success, he couldn't prevent the British from taking Bangalore and threatening Srirangapatna. Tipu's efforts to harass the British supply and communication proved effective, forcing Cornwallis to withdraw.<br><br>In 1792, Tipu's fortunes turned. The allied army, well-supplied and united, laid siege to Srirangapatna. After negotiations, Tipu was compelled to cede half his territories, deliver two sons as hostages until he paid a significant war indemnity, which he did in two installments.<br><br>This campaign marked Tipu Sultan's defeat and the significant loss of his territories and resources to the British and their allies.

                <h2 class="subheading">Conflicts with Maratha Confederacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Under Peshwa Madhavrao I, the Maratha Empire regained dominance over much of the Indian subcontinent, defeating Tipu Sultan's father, Hyder Ali, in 1764 and 1767. In 1767, Maratha forces led by Madhavrao entered Srirangapatna, Mysore's capital, and Hyder Ali acknowledged Maratha supremacy, receiving the title of Nawab of Mysore.<br><br>However, Tipu Sultan sought to break free from the Maratha treaty and challenge their authority. This led to the Maratha-Mysore War, marked by a series of conflicts:
                    <br>Siege of Nargund (February 1785) – Won by Mysore<br>
                    Siege of Badami (May 1786) – Mysore surrendered<br>
                    Siege of Adoni (June 1786) – Won by Mysore<br>
                    Battle of Gajendragad (June 1786) – Won by Marathas<br>
                    Battle of Savanur (October 1786) – Won by Mysore<br>
                    Siege of Bahadur Benda (January 1787) – Won by Mysore<br>
                    <br><br>The conflict culminated in the Treaty of Gajendragad (March 1787), which stipulated that Tipu Sultan would return the territory captured by his father, Hyder Ali, to the Maratha Empire. Tipu agreed to pay the Marathas a tribute of 4.8 million rupees, settling four years' worth of arrears. In return, the Marathas recognized Tipu Sultan as "Nabob Tipu Sultan Futteh Ally Khan." Tipu also returned various regions and agreed to pay an annual tribute for four years.<br><br>The treaty marked the end of hostilities and defined the territorial boundaries between Mysore and the Maratha Empire. Notably, in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, the Marathas supported the East India Company against Tipu Sultan.

                <h2 class="subheading">Napoleon's attempt at a junction</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1794, reportedly with the support of French Republican officers, Tipu Sultan was said to have helped establish the Jacobin Club of Mysore, adopting the title "Citizen Tipoo" and planting a Liberty Tree. However, some historians, including Jean Boutier, argue that the existence of the club and Tipu's involvement were potentially fabricated by the East India Company to provide a pretext for British military action against Tipu.<br><br>Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt in 1798 had aspirations of establishing a connection with India to challenge British influence. He aimed to create a French presence in the Middle East and sought to collaborate with Tipu Sultan against the British. Napoleon planned to send forces to India through Egypt, forming a joint offensive with Tipu Sultan to expel the British from their Indian possessions.<br><br>Napoleon's intentions were outlined in a report by Talleyrand, stating that after occupying Egypt, he would send 15,000 troops from Suez to India to join forces with Tipu Sultan. This plan, however, did not materialize as Napoleon faced defeats in battles such as the Siege of Acre in 1799 and the Battle of Abukir in 1801, undermining his ambitions of linking with Tipu Sultan against the British.

                <h2 class="subheading">Death</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1799, Horatio Nelson achieved victory over François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers at the Battle of the Nile in Egypt, while in Mysore, three armies marched against Tipu Sultan's forces. The British launched the Fourth Mysore War with more than 60,000 soldiers from the British East India Company, joined by European and Indian troops. In contrast, Tipu Sultan's forces numbered around 30,000. His ministers' betrayal and cooperation with the British weakened the city's defenses, facilitating their entry.<br><br>During the siege of Srirangapatna, Tipu Sultan's refusal to escape via secret passages and continue the fight from other forts demonstrated his steadfastness. He famously declared, "Better to live one day as a tiger than a thousand years as a sheep."<br><br>Tragically, Tipu Sultan was killed at the Hoally Gateway, near the Srirangapatna Fort's N.E. Angle. He was laid to rest beside his father at the Gumaz the following afternoon. Some believed that Nawab of Carnatic Umdat Ul-Umra secretly aided Tipu Sultan during the war.<br><br>The news of Tipu Sultan's death prompted jubilant celebrations in Britain, leading to public holidays and creative works commemorating the event. His demise marked a significant turning point, with British General Harris famously declaring, "Now India is ours."
