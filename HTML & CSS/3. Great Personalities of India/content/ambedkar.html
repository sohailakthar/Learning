                <h2 class="subheading">Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer, and political leader. He chaired the committee that drafted India's Constitution, served as Law and Justice minister under Jawaharlal Nehru, and led the Dalit Buddhist movement after leaving Hinduism.<br><br>Ambedkar graduated from Elphinstone College and earned economics doctorates from Columbia University and the London School of Economics in the 1920s. He also studied law at Gray's Inn, London. Initially an economist, professor, and lawyer, he later became a prominent political figure. He campaigned for partition, advocated for Dalit rights, and contributed to India's establishment. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass Dalit conversions.<br><br>Ambedkar received the Bharat Ratna posthumously in 1990 and is honored with the salutation "Jai Bhim." He is affectionately referred to as "Babasaheb," meaning "Respected Father."

                <h2 class="subheading">Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in Mhow (now Dr Ambedkar Nagar), Madhya Pradesh. He was the 14th child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer, and Bhimabai Sakpal from a Marathi background in Maharashtra. Born into the Mahar (dalit) caste, he faced discrimination and segregation, even in education. His family moved to Satara after his father's retirement, and Ambedkar's mother passed away soon after. Raised by his aunt, he faced challenging circumstances. Ambedkar's original surname was Sakpal, later changed to Ambedkar by his teacher Krishnaji Keshav Ambedkar.

                <h2 class="subheading">Education</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1897, Ambedkar's family relocated to Mumbai, where he became the sole untouchable student at Elphinstone High School. In 1906, at around 15 years old, he entered into an arranged marriage with a nine-year-old girl named Ramabai. He passed his matriculation examination in 1907 and joined Elphinstone College, becoming the first Mahar caste member to do so. By 1912, he earned his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University and began working for the Baroda state government. In 1913, he received a scholarship to pursue postgraduate education at Columbia University in New York City, where he completed his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in economics. He was also influenced by John Dewey's work on democracy.<br><br>Ambedkar then enrolled in the Bar course at Gray's Inn and pursued a doctoral thesis at the London School of Economics. His academic journey continued, and in 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics from the University of London and was called to the Bar. His studies and research played a significant role in shaping his later activism and contributions to social and political reform.

                <h2 class="subheading">Marriage</h2>
                <p>
                    Ambedkar's first wife, Ramabai, passed away in 1935 after a prolonged illness. In the late 1940s, after completing the draft of India's constitution, he faced health challenges such as lack of sleep, neuropathic leg pain, and was managing diabetes with insulin and homoeopathic medicines. Seeking treatment in Bombay, he met Sharada Kabir and they married on April 15, 1948. She became his companion, providing care and support. She adopted the name Savita Ambedkar and cared for him until his death. Savita Ambedkar, also known as 'Mai,' passed away on May 29, 2003, at the age of 93 in Mumbai.

                <h2 class="subheading">Opposition to Untouchability</h2>
                <p>
                    After his education, Ambedkar initially served the Princely State of Baroda as Military Secretary but had to resign shortly after. He faced challenges in finding stable employment due to discrimination. He worked as a private tutor, accountant, and attempted an investment consulting business that failed due to his untouchable status. In 1918, he became a professor of political economy at Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai, facing objections from colleagues about sharing a drinking-water jug.<br><br>Ambedkar's involvement in social and political causes continued. He testified before the Southborough Committee in 1919, advocating for separate electorates and reservations for untouchables. In 1920, he began publishing the weekly newspaper "Mooknayak" in Mumbai. He also defended non-Brahmin leaders in a libel case in 1926.<br><br>Ambedkar worked to uplift the untouchable community, establishing organizations like the Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha for education and welfare. He participated in the Bombay Presidency Committee working alongside the Simon Commission in 1925 and drafted recommendations for India's future Constitution.<br><br>In 1927, he initiated movements against untouchability, advocating for the right to use public water resources and enter Hindu temples. He famously condemned the Manusmriti for justifying caste discrimination and burned copies of it in public protests. He led the Kalaram Temple satyagraha in 1930, a significant protest demanding entry for untouchables into the temple. Ambedkar's efforts contributed significantly to social reform and the struggle for Dalit rights in India.

                <h2 class="subheading">Drafting of India's Constitution</h2>
                <p>
                    Upon India's independence in 1947, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru invited Ambedkar to serve as the Law Minister of the Dominion of India. Two weeks later, he was appointed as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee for the Constitution of the future Republic of India.<br><br>Ambedkar acknowledged that the credit for the Constitution does not solely belong to him but also to Sir B.N. Rau, the Constitutional Advisor, who prepared a rough draft for the consideration of the Drafting Committee.<br><br>The Indian Constitution, drafted under Ambedkar's leadership, enshrined a wide range of civil liberties for citizens, including religious freedom, the abolition of untouchability, and the prohibition of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar advocated for extensive economic and social rights for women and successfully advocated for the introduction of reservations in civil services, schools, and colleges for members of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and Other Backward Classes, aiming to address socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities.<br><br>The Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949 by the Constituent Assembly. However, in 1953, Ambedkar expressed his disapproval of the Constitution during a parliamentary session, stating that he had done what he was asked to do against his will. He even mentioned his willingness to burn it, saying it did not suit anyone.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Death</h2>
                <p>
                    Ambedkar's health declined after being diagnosed with diabetes in 1948. In 1954, he spent several months in bed due to medication side effects and poor eyesight. His health deteriorated further in 1955. On December 6, 1956, Ambedkar passed away in his sleep at his home in Delhi, shortly after completing his final manuscript, "The Buddha and His Dhamma."<br><br>A Buddhist cremation took place at Dadar Chowpatty beach on December 7, attended by a large crowd. A conversion program on December 16 converted attendees to Buddhism at the same location.<br><br>Ambedkar was survived by his second wife, Savita Ambedkar, and his son, Yashwant Ambedkar, who continued his socio-religious movement. Yashwant served as the President of the Buddhist Society of India and a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Council. Ambedkar's grandsons, Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar and Anandraj Ambedkar, also played active roles in various social and political endeavors.<br><br>Numerous unfinished drafts and notes were found among Ambedkar's papers, including "Waiting for a Visa" and "The Untouchables, or the Children of India's Ghetto."<br><br>A memorial for Ambedkar was established at his Delhi house, and his birthdate is observed as a public holiday in many Indian states. He was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1990. His legacy is celebrated annually on his birth and death anniversaries and on Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din.<br><br>Ambedkar's message to his followers was "educate, agitate, organise!"
