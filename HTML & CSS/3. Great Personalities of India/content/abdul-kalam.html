                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was the 11th President of India (2002-2007), renowned as an aerospace scientist. Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he excelled in physics and aerospace engineering. His extensive career spanned the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), earning him the title "Missile Man of India" for his pioneering work in missile technology and space programs. He played a key role in India's nuclear tests in 1998. Kalam's presidency was marked by widespread popularity, and after his term, he continued his pursuits in education, writing, and public service.

                <h2 class="subheading">Early Life and Education</h2>
                <p>
                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, hailed from a Tamil Muslim family. His father, Jainulabdeen Marakayar, was a mosque imam and boat owner, while his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. As the youngest of five siblings, Kalam's family had a history of trade and land ownership but faced financial struggles. Their business, involving ferrying pilgrims and trading, declined with the opening of the Pamban Bridge in 1914. Despite their impoverished circumstances, Kalam's determination to learn was evident from a young age. He sold newspapers to contribute to the family income.<br><br>Kalam displayed dedication to his studies, particularly in Mathematics. After completing his education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School and Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, he graduated in physics from the University of Madras in 1954. He pursued aerospace engineering at Madras Institute of Technology. Notably, Kalam overcame a challenging project deadline set by the Dean, impressing him. Although he narrowly missed his aspiration of becoming a fighter pilot due to ranking ninth in qualifiers, his journey toward becoming a renowned scientist and statesman was well underway.

                <h2 class="subheading">Career as a Scientist</h2>
                <p>
                    After completing his studies at the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Abdul Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist, marking the beginning of his illustrious career. His initial work included designing a small hovercraft, but he soon transitioned to the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), later known as ISRO. Under the guidance of renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai, Kalam's contributions to India's space endeavors became significant.<br><br>In 1969, Kalam took on a pivotal role at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), leading the development of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) that successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in 1980. His involvement with expandable rocket projects dates back to his time at DRDO in 1965. Kalam's expertise extended to the development of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which achieved notable success in the 1970s and 1990s.<br><br>Kalam's influence also extended to the defense sector, where he played a crucial part in projects such as Project Devil and Project Valiant, aimed at developing ballistic missiles based on SLV technology. His leadership in research and education earned him prestige, leading to the initiation of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). This program encompassed the development of missiles like Agni and Prithvi, although some projects faced criticism for management and budget issues.<br><br>From 1992 to 1999, Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation. He played an intensive role in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests and became a prominent figure in India's nuclear science landscape. Kalam's contributions extended beyond science; he collaborated with cardiologist Soma Raju to develop a low-cost coronary stent and later designed a tablet computer for healthcare in rural areas.

Kalam filed his nomination in June 2002, and the polling took place on 18 July, resulting in his easy victory. During his presidency, he was known as the "People's President" and was praised for his decision-making, although he faced criticism for his handling of mercy petitions and the imposition of President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.<br><br>Kalam's tenure saw his advocacy for a Uniform Civil Code and his support for various political fronts. He was the third President of India to receive the Bharat Ratna and the first scientist to occupy Rashtrapati Bhavan. Kalam considered a second term but later declined, expressing gratitude for the public's support.<br><br>In 2012, there were discussions about nominating Kalam for a second term, although he eventually declined.

                <p>
                    Daily namaz (prayer) and fasting during Ramadan were important practices in Kalam's life as a devout Sunni Muslim. His father, an imam, instilled these Islamic customs in him and his siblings. Kalam emphasized interfaith respect and dialogue, influenced by discussions his father had with a Hindu priest and a church priest. He believed in the value of cooperation among religious, social, and political leaders to address India's challenges. Kalam considered religion a means of building friendships and advocated for respect for other faiths, often saying, "For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool."
