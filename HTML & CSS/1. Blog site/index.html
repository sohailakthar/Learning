                    Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist known for his nonviolent resistance in leading India to independence from British rule. His honorific title "Mahātmā," meaning "great-souled" or "venerable," reflects his revered status globally. Born in Gujarat, Gandhi studied law in London and began practicing in India. He gained prominence during his time in South Africa, where he championed civil rights using nonviolent methods. Returning to India in 1915, he organized protests against land tax and discrimination, advocating for unity and self-sufficiency.Gandhi assumed leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 and spearheaded campaigns against poverty, women's rights, and untouchability. He embraced a minimalist lifestyle, donning hand-spun clothes and using fasting for self-purification and political protest. His symbolic acts left an indelible impact. The historic Dandi Salt March in 1930 challenged British salt taxes, and his call for the Quit India Movement in 1942 demanded an end to British rule. He endured numerous imprisonments, steadfastly promoting nonviolent resistance. Gandhi's vision of a harmonious, independent India faced challenges during the partition of British India in 1947, resulting in the creation of India and Pakistan. He actively worked to ease religious tensions during this time. Tragically, Gandhi was assassinated in 1948. His birthday, October 2, is celebrated as Gandhi Jayanti in India and the International Day of Nonviolence worldwide. His principles of nonviolence, civil disobedience, and social justice continue to inspire movements for change across the globe.

                    Sarojini Naidu (1879–1949) was an Indian political activist and poet, known as the "Nightingale of India." She held significant roles in the Indian independence movement, advocating civil rights, women's emancipation, and anti-imperialism. Naidu was the first Indian woman to lead the Indian National Congress and serve as a state governor. Born in Hyderabad to a Bengali family, she studied in Madras, London, and Cambridge, engaging in suffrage work in Britain. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's principles of swaraj, she joined the national movement, eventually becoming Congress president in 1925. Her poetic work, praised for its imagery and lyrical quality, covered various themes, including patriotism and tragedy. Notably, her poem "In the Bazaars of Hyderabad," published in 1912, remains widely celebrated.
